| Project | Description | Tech |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `titanic_eda.ipynb` | Exploratory data analysis of Titanic survival data; descriptive stats & visualisations. | pandas, seaborn |

**Key takeaway:**  
A random-forest classifier improves ROC-AUC by ~6 pp over a logistic-regression baseline.  
Top predictive features were passenger class and gender, confirming historical accounts that first-class women had the highest survival odds.
